Create a mobile application for now only for Andoid. Lets use Android KitKat 4.4 as the minimum version for our app.

Asignee : AK

IS : I suggest that the mobile app is created on the same level with the web application with a name similar to "socialworld-mobile" or "socialworld-android"

AK : Created the mobile application with blank activity. I created it with minimum android version Lollipop (API 21). Let's discuss the pros and cons of using Lollipop as minimum version.

Done : 100%;
