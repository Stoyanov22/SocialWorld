We need to create an entity to hold the user object. This has to be the same for both mobile and web versions. For the first
stage we can just create all the properties, methods and constructors that the object will need. Later on we should add
the properties which will navigate to the user's reference objects.

Asignee : IS

21.03.2020: Basic entity created. Constructors created only for the available functions. 
Method and navigation properties are yet to be implemented.

Done : 100%;
