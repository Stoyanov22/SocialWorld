From the web interface we should have a form for logging and registering into the system. This form should be available only
in the home page. 

Asignee : IS

The form is hidden in the first entry of the screen. It is toggled on clicking on the Login button. If the user inputs an 
email which isn't registred in the database the form will automatically move to registring a new user. After the form is 
filled - if everything is alright a HttpSession is created and the user is redirected to his news feed.

Comment : Currently it is redirecting back to Home page. The other is ready.
Comment : Fixed. All redirections seem correct. The home page can only be accessed by non-authenticated users and the news 
feed page can only be access by users with registration and active session.

Done : 100%;
